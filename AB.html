                  " Thanks Software Solutions for great support on our project.
                  They not only showed their commitment and hard work in our project, but also helped us take care of
                  some points that got missed by us and did not belong to their scope.
                  It is a great help if the objective is in making the service successful, instead of just completing
                  the project.
                  The experience working with SS is great.
                  Thanks and please keep on the same service and accountability! "</p>

                  " Partnering with Software Solutions was the first and single most important decision I took as a
                  founder of a
                  digital health startup. In Software Solutions. we found a true collaborator to help transform our
                  ideas into
                  a digital health solution, not just a software application. User experience was always given the
                  highest priority. As in any tech. development life cycle, there were challenges, bugs, roadblocks, and
                  occasional pivots. However, Prasad, Atharva, and the team were always available, and just a phone call
                  away, which was very reassuring. Our ad-hoc requests were handled in an expedited manner, and we were
                  kept in the loop. The results speak for themselves. We have a fully functional SAAS solution with
                  several wearable and digital device integrations and a platform that delivers a very complex chronic
                  disease treatment in real-time and remotely. The short-term engagement has matured into a long-term
                  collaboration and we look forward to working with them as we grow. "

                  the business. Our work relationship has been productive and we have collectively been able to achieve

                  " We have been working with SS team for over 2 years now. I must say we have a come a long way
                  together and SS has done a wonderful job. At the beginning, Xeliumtech went into details for
                  our requirements and came up with lot of important questions and this really helped us figure out a
                  number of gaps in our requirements. SS has been very flexible to deal with our ad-hoc
                  requests, which was an extremely important factor for us while developing a complex product. I
                  definitely see Xeliumtech as a long-term IT partner for us. "

                  Software Solutions team had detailed questions and feedback after we had presented our APP concepts and
                  framework. SS's attention to detail helped to sharply define the project and its workflow,
